                    <p class="article-text">Kanji is one of the three scripts used to write the Japanese language. Unlike Hiragana and Katakana, the other two scripts, kanji is a logographic script, meaning that its letters (generally) represent meaning instead of sound.</p>
                    <p class="article-text">Kanji was imported to Japan from China by the way of Korea sometime in the 5th century. As such, to know the origins of kanji, you have to understand the origins of Hanzi, as the script is called in Chinese.</p>
                    <p class="article-text">Hanzi was developed by the Chinese around 3000 years ago. Back then, it was a rudimentary writing system used to carve into bones and other hard objects, such as turtle shells, and did not contain as many characters as it does today.</p>
                    <p class="article-text">As Chinese civilization developed, their writing system did as well, leading to thousands of new characters being introduced into it. It was this more complete form of Hanzi that later would become kanji.</p>

                <h3 class="article-header-text">How Kanji Work</h3>
                <p class="article-text">Kanji are composed of smaller elements known as radicals. These constitute the most basic semantic elements of the script. This sometimes gives the impression that each kanji is constructed by simply intuiting the meaning of all these elements together, but it's not that simple.</p>
                <p class="article-text">To understand the logic behind how each radical contributes to the kanji itself, you have to understand the history of how they were developed in China. Depending on how they were formed, they are classified into one of six camps.</p>
                <ul class="article-text">
                    <li><b>Pictograms</b>
                        <br>Kanji that simply look like what they are supposed to represent. They were the first kind of kanji to be introduced and are few in number.
                        <br>Examples of pictograms are 山 (mountain) and 火 (fire).
                        <br>These could not represent things which aren't physical, and so another category was needed.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Ideograms</b>
                        <br>Kanji whose shape represent an idea or concept without a set physical form.
                        <br>Examples of ideograms are 上 (up) and 下 (down).
                        <br>Like pictograms, they proved to be too simple to easily expand into more complicated concepts, and so once again, a new category was needed.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Compound Ideograms</b>
                        <br>Kanji constructed from combinations of smaller kanji (radicals) to extrapolate an idea or meaning.
                        <br>Examples of compound ideograms are 煩 (trouble, fire + paper) or 休 (rest, person + tree).
                        <br>While capable of much more advanced meanings, they were not intuitive enough to be easily understood.
                        <br>As they were so removed from the language, it was not always clear how they were to be said, and so finally another type of kanji emerged.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Phono-Semantic Compounds</b>
                        <br>Kanji made up of a phonetic element (indicating pronounciation) and a semantic element (indicating meaning).
                        <br>A good example is 被 (wear), whose left-most radical indicates it has something to do with cloth, while its right-most indicates it is pronounced the same as 皮 (leather).
                        <br>Generally speaking, the left-most element is the semantic, and the right-most is the phonetic, though this is not always the case.
                        <br>Phono-semantic compounds make up about 80% of all kanji. The Chinese of the first millennium must have found them exceedingly convenient.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="article-text">There are two more categories, but they are hard to understand and not very important, so I won't explain them here. However, because the vast majority of kanji is made up of the 4th category, knowing how they work is key to understand the script.</p>
                <p class="article-text">That said, Japanese and Chinese are, as far as languages go, extremely different, which is why in order to accomodate the Chinese script to Japanese, you need to make a lot of adjustments.</p>
                <p class="article-text">First among these adjustments is that each kanji has two different classes of <b>readings</b>, i.e, pronounciations. These two are called <b>kunyomi</b> and <b>onyomi</b>. Kunyomi represent a Japanese word, while onyomi represent the original chinese pronounciation, but filtered through the rather simple Japanese phonetic system.</p>
                <div class="image basics"></div>
                <p class="article-text">Japanese sounds are very limited, so a lot of the complex sound similarities formed through the phono-semantic compounds in Chinese all blend together.</p>
                <p class="article-text">And as if to make matters worse, onyomi itself is divided into 4 groups depending on when and from where the kanji entered Japanese. These four are known as <b>Go-on</b>, <b>Kan-on</b>, <b>To-on</b>, <b>Kan'yo on</b> and as a result, many kanji have up to five readings.</p>
                <p class="article-text">You might also think that "at least kunyomi doesn't seem as complicated", but in actuality, it is the more complicated category. Exactly how many and what kunyomi a kanji have is largely arbitrary. Some words have upwards of 20 kunyomi, while others have none. 生 famously has <b><i>22 common readings</i></b>, and more depending on how you count them.</p>
                <p class="article-text">And this isn't even getting into name readings, known as <b>Nanori</b> which do not follow any rule whatsoever and can be invented wholesale by the parent naming their child. No wonder then, that when people introduce themselves in Japan, they both write their name and say it out loud. The name <b>Takeshi</b> (a common male given name) has probably been written in hundreds, if not thousands of different ways.</p>
                <p class="article-text">There are of course more things to know about kanji, but I will leave some of that in the advanced section. Keep reading!</p>

                <p class="article-text">Despite how kanji is commonly used as described above, there are many notable exceptions from this mold. In fact, many very common Japanese words do not follow the above rules whatsoever! These words are classified under two other categories.</p>
                <ul class="article-text">
                    <li><a href="./html/gikun.html"><b>Gikun</b></a>
                        <br>Though most kanji abide by their designated reading, certain words composed out of several kanji have an attribute whereby the collective reading changes from something which does not reflect the individual kanjis. These are known as Gikun and are very unpredictable. If you want to read more, visit the page <a href="./html/gikun.html">here</a>.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><a href="./html/ateji.html"><b>Ateji</b></a>
                        <br>The earliest way that kanji was employed by the Japanese was much in the same way that our alphabet works. This system, known as <b>man'yogana</b>, would employ the chinese characters to represent a sound, like <i>ha</i> or <i>be</i>. Ateji is a continuation of this practice, although by now very rare. It is commonly seen in older loan-words. If you want to read more, visit the page <a href="./html/ateji.html">here</a>
